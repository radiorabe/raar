# RAAR Import

The importer takes care of adding recorded audio files into the archive database.

See [Architecture](architecture.md) for details on the import settings.

## Recordings

The import processes audio files from a external sources, aka recordings. The way these files are created is not part of RAAR. Refer to [Recording](recording.md) in case you don't already have a recording solution. The following pre-conditions must hold:

* The audio files are put in the directories defined by `IMPORT_DIRECTORIES`.
* Multiple directories may contain different recordings for the same times (for failover purposes), but with the same duration.
* Recording durations do not have to correspond to broadcast durations.
* The recording file names must be in the format `yyyy-mm-ddTHHMMSSÂ±ZZZZ_{ddd,PTaaHbbMccS}.*` (year '-' month '-' day 'T' hour minute second '+/-' time zone offset '_' { duration in minutes OR 'PT' hours 'H' minutes 'M' seconds 'S' (= ISO 8061 time period) } '.' extension, e.g. '2015-02-12T120000+0200_090.mp3' OR '2015-02-12T120000+0200_PT1H30M.mp3').

## Procedure

The following steps are performed during the import process. The respective Classes/Methods are given in parentheses.

1. The import is started (`Import.run`).
1. Find all recordings in the `IMPORT_DIRECTORIES` (`Import::Recording::Finder#pending`).
1. Based on the timestamps given in the recording file names, map the recordings to their respective broadcasts (`Import::BroadcastMapping::Builder#run`). Different strategies would be possible by implementing different `Import::BroadcastMapping::Builder`s. Currently, this data is fetched directly for an Airtime database (`Import::BroadcastMapping::Builder::AirtimeDb`). If no mappings are found but a `IMPORT_DEFAULT_SHOW_ID` is defined, broadcasts mappings for this show are created.
1. For each broadcast mapping, do the following (`Import::Importer#run`):
1. If the recordings do not cover the entire broadcast duration, cancel and retry later.
1. If one day after the broadcast the recordings do not cover the entire broadcast duration and the gaps are less than 15 minutes, continue anyways. It is better to import what is there than to import nothing.
1. Select the best recordings to work with (`Import::Recording::Chooser#best`).
1. If the recording duration does not match the broadcast duration, cut the audio file(s) accordingly to get one single master file for the broadcast (`Import::Recording::Composer#compose`).
1. Transcode the master file into the defined archive formats in the `ARCHIVE_HOME` directory and create the corresponding database entries (`Import::Archiver#run`).
1. Mark the used recordings as imported (`Import::Recording#mark_imported`).
1. Delete all old imported recordings as configured by `DAYS_TO_KEEP_IMPORTED` and warn about unimported recordings, via `DAYS_TO_FINISH_IMPORT` (`Import::Recording::Cleaner#run`).

## Custom Import

It is also possible to run an import with custom classes given by environment variables. To import all MP3 recordings from a given directory that contain the date, time and show name in their filename (i.e. without hitting Airtime), run:

    BROADCAST_MAPPING_BUILDER=SelfContained \
    RECORDING_FILE=Mp3Rec \
    IMPORT_DIRECTORIES=/path/to/import \
    DAYS_TO_FINISH_IMPORT='' \
    DAYS_TO_KEEP_IMPORTED='' \
    IMPORT_DEFAULT_SHOW_ID='' \
    RAILS_LOG=/path/to/logfile \
    bin/import

The show names from the file names may be mapped to real show names in `config/show_names.yml`.
